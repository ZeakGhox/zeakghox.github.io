~~Predicting Reversal of High Blood Pressure Using Machine Learning~~

MSDS 696 – Data Science Practicum II

Weeks 1 - 5 – Progress Report Summary

**Planned Work for the Week:**

* Identify viable data sources

**Progress for the Week:**

* Determined that there is no reasonable path forward with this project topic

**Roadblocks/Issues:** 

* I have been unable to locate data sources that would provide for reporting of medication, supplements, and/or exercise along with a high blood pressure diagnosis or systolic/diastolic blood pressure readings. There are certainly surveys and datasets that capture some of this information but even what is captured is a single snapshot and nothing that I have found gives this data for the same individuals over time. Were I to use the snapshot-type datasets then I could not realistically be able to say that any changes in conditions were for the same individuals and were therefore the result of any particular action on the part of an individual.

**Plan for next Week:**

* Quickly spin up a new, viable project

**Resources for the Week:**

* None
