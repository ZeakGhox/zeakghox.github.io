**Life Expectancy and the Impact of Economic and Environmental Factors**

MSDS 696 – Data Science Practicum II

Week 6 – Progress Report

**Project Details**

This project seeks to understand the relationship that economic impacts and environmental factors have on global health issues. Machine learning models will be employed to analyze the impacts of economic and environmental shifts.

(*Note:* My project was changed during Week 6, following the project review, as a result of an inability to identify and source data for the previous topic.)
